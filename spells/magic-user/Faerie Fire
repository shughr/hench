description = """
A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects, making them hypervisible. Outlined subjects shed light that makes them visible in darkness at a distance of 80', or half this if the creatures are near a light source. The Magic-user can affect creatures within a 40' radius, and may outline up to one human-sized creature per caster level. The *Faerie Fire* can be blue, green, or violet, according to the Magic-user's choice at the time of casting. The *Faerie Fire* does not cause any harm to the object or creatures thus outlined. However, the greater visibility grants attackers a +2 bonus to hit them while the spell is in effect."""
