description = """This spell allows the caster to know if anything within their field of vision (or on their person) is in any way magical. This includes magical creatures, magical items, or any creature or object under the effect of an ongoing spell. Spellcasters such as Magic-user and Elves do not detect as magic with this spell, but anyone that is under the effects of an active spell does.

The spell does not identify the nature of the magic, only that magic is present.

The caster must already be able to see the object in question in order to detect it as magical. Concealed, covered, or invisible objects will not be revealed by this spell."""
