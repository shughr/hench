description = """
A *Sleep* spell causes a magic slumber to come upon creatures with 4+1 or fewer Hit Dice. The caster can only affect 1 creature if it has 4+1 or more Hit Dice, but the spell will otherwise affect creatures totaling no more than 2d8 Hit Dice. Calculate creatures with less than 1 Hit Dice as having 1 Hit Die, and creatures with a bonus to their Hit Dice as having the flat amount. For example, a 3+2 Hit Dice creature would be calculated as having 3 Hit Dice. Excess Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. *Sleep* does not affect undead, constructs, or other magical or unnatural creatures (such as Elves)."""
