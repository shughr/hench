description = """
The affected creatures or objects in range fall slowly. *Feather Fall* instantly changes the rate at which the target falls to that of a feather (about 5' per Round), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. The spell ends immediately when the subject stops falling.

The spell can affect one or more objects or creatures, including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum encumbrance. the maximum volume is a 10' cube, and 200 pounds + 200 pounds per level can also be affected, such that a 1st level Magic-User can affect 400 pounds.

The spell can be cast with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save the caster or another creature if he unexpectedly falls, but Initiative, if appropriate, must be on the side of the caster. The spell can be cast on falling items or creatures and missiles, but is ineffective against creatures firmly on the ground or flying. No saving throw is permitted."""
