description = """
*Mending* repairs small breaks or tears in objects. It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists. Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wine skin is completely healed over by *Mending*. The spell cannot repair magic items, nor does it affect creatures."""
