description = """
This spell makes an object appealing to the microcosmic forces of magic, giving the item an aura that causes it to register to *Detect* spells (and spells with similar effects) as though it were magical. If the object bearing *Magic Aura* is physically examined (touched), the examiner recognizes that the aura is false if he succeeds in a saving throw versus Magic. Otherwise, he believes the aura, but no amount of testing reveals what the true magic is. 

The reverse of this spell, *Obscure Aura*, hides the magic aura of a legitimate magical item. A Magic-user casting *Detect Magic* and actually handling the item is permitted a saving throw versus Magic to see the magical aura of the item."""
