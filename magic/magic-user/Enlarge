description = """
The forces of magic do not recognize the relationships of size and distance between things; it is the limitations of the mind's ability to master magic that results in strictures such as "spell range," but sometimes the infinite nature of magic can be applied to material objects. This spell causes instant growth (and corresponding increase in weight and damage done) of a single object or creature that is in visible range. This increase changes a creature's size by 20% per caster level, up to three times the original size of the creature. The effectiveness of this spell is reduced by half on non-living objects, which are only enlarged 10% per level and to a maximum of double the original size of the object. The caster can affect a 10' cube of living matter per level or a 5' cube per level of non-living matter.

Magical item properties are not affected by this spell. For instance, a wand will have the same function even though it is increased to the size of a staff, and potion dosages are not increased, though they may take longer to drink. Objects *do* become stronger or heavier, so that a small rock gains the weigh of an appropriately sized larger one, and a person enlarged will have a strength appropriate to his size (as an ogre or a giant, for example) with corresponding strength adjustments.

The damage done by an *Enlarged* character during melee is increased by the same percentage as their size.

The reverse of *Enlarge*, *Reduce*, can reduce objects or creatures in size by the same proportions as *Enlarge*. These spells cancel each other out. For either version of the spell a saving throw versus Magic is allowed to negate the effect. This save can be forfeited if the recipient desires.
