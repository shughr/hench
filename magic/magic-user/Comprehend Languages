description = """
The caster can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages by summoning the spirits of the all-knowing dead to translate for them. The creature or the writing must be touched by the caster before the spirits can deliver any translation. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables the caster to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.

*Obscure Languages*, the opposite of *Comprehend Languages*, dispels the effects of *Comprehend Languages*, or can be used to make spoken or written language incomprehensible by summoning spirits to possess the lips of a speaker, or the eyes of a reader, ruining all chances of communication."""
