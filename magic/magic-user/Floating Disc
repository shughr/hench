description = """
The caster creates a slightly concave, circular plane of force that follows him about and carries a heavy load for them. The disk is 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch deep at its center. It can hold 500 pounds. If used to transport a liquid, its capacity is 2 gallons. The disk floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within spell range and will accompany horizontally within spell range and will accompany the caster with an equal movement rate. If not otherwise directed, it maintains a constant interval of 6' between itself and the caster, and will follow the caster without prompting to maintain a minimum of 6'. When the disk winks out at the end of the spell's duration, whatever it was supporting falls to the surface beneath it."""
