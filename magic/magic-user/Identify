description = """
This spell allows the Magic-user to discern the magical properties of an item. The spell requires one uninterrupted day in a laboratory worth at least 1,000 sp to cast. At the end of the day, the Magic-user will have successfully determined one magical property of an item. The character will not know if there are additional properties unless they cast *Identify* again and another magical property of the item is determined. he will only know all of the magical properties of an item when he casts the spell and no new property is identified; both the "wasted" day and the "wasted casting of *Identify* confirming that the item has no further properties. Note that a cursed item will not be identified as cursed, bu as the item it pretends to be. This spell does not reveal command words. Each casting of the spell, successful or not, requires the expenditure of 100 sp worth of ingredients."""
