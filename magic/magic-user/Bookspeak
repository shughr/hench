description = """
When the subject of this spell touches a book, it animates, forming a mouth around the edge where the paper shows. The subject can ask the book one question per Round,and if the information is contained within the book, it will answer. If anyone else approaches or asks questions the book snaps and growls that Round instead of answering a question. Intelligent books can save to resist the spell (as a Magic-User ofa level equal to the author). Magical books do not impart their effect when they answer.The spell is a shortcut to actually reading a book, and it will not give more information than a careful reading would.
